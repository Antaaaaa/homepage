# Homepage

My very own personal website. Basically this is just a résumé.

# 🤷 About Customer
I was wonder to get more info about my client, cuz he's not a common person at all. So briefly:

### FEAR 😱, SHAME 😳, BRUTALITY ⚔️ 

That's not about him...I meant all except BRUTALITYYYYYY. Such a foolish article writer, he has to be dead 😔. <br>
So **RYU HOSHI** has a lot of powerful techniques. He's even able to destroy enemy's soul, so that's way I had no choice (HELP). 
He asked me to create a little website because, "sensei tells me that there’s a lot of money on the Internet, and a whole lot less getting punched in the face.". There is a simple preview below and yep if this website doesnt fit him, say my mom that I loved JAVA 🙏(Press F).
